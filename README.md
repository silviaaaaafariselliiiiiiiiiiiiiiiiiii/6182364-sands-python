This package contains all the files required for the Python part of the course Systems and Signals. The toml file contains the required information on the dependencies and installation.
The following is a summary of what each file executes:

hello.py: among the first files used to help understand how git hub works

Signals.py: contains functions to generate different wave forms
-sine wave
-sawtooth wave
-triangular wave
-square wave
-unit step function
recuring parameters are frequency, duration and sample rate

signaloperations.py: contains functions to run operations/modifications on the signals
-amplify
-time shift
-addition 
-multipication
-convolution
recuring parameters are signal1, signal2 

run.py: contains the calls for the functions found in signals.py  and signaloperations.py. It plots the sine wave and unit step function

test.py: runs the tests to verify whether signals and operations are done properly. All tests were succesfull.
