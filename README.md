This repository contains all the files required for the Python part of the course Systems and Signals. 
The following is a summary of what each file executes:

hello.py: among the first files used to help understand how git hub works

Signals.py: contains functions to generate different wave forms
-sine wave
-sawtooth wave
-triangular wave
-square wave
-unit step function
recuring parameters are frequency, duration and sample rate

signaloperations.py: contains functions to run operations/modifications on the signals
-amplify
-time shift
-addition 
-multipication
-convolution
recuring parameters are signal1, signal2 

run.py: contains the calls for the functions found in signals.py  and signaloperations.py. It plots the sine wave and unit step function
